==== Building the Project ======

---- Introducing JaVill----


---- Website Building -----

For my interactive site page, the client did not yet have their own website. However, they showed me some promotional shots they'd taken for their upcoming release. The tones were blank and white, with a water ripple foil cast over the set in gold. I chose to build my assets in a muted colours to match the JaVill branding. 

After our first conversation about this project, I drew the band members on a napkin as an example. The characters were 8-bit and 16-bit caracitures of the band members.
