Planning the project 

======= The plan =======

Jonathan needs a game for his website. Will collect deatails over the weekend


* A classic infinite run n jumper
* Character selector - select from pixel art of the four band mates
* They get bigger when selected
* The character runs a stage
* Jump to clear amps, crouch to clear mics on a stand
* Database for high scores 

==== Building the Project ======
---- Website Building -----

For my interactive site page, the client did not yet have their own website. However, they showed me some promotional shots they'd taken for their upcoming release. The tones were blank and white, with a water ripple foil cast over the set in gold.
